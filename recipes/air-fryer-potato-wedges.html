    <h2>How to Make Potato Wedges</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>

    <p>Seasoned potato wedges are placed in the basket of an air fryer and cooked for 10 minutes. The wedges are 
    <br> with tongs and cooked for an additional five minutes, to ensure maximum crispiness. </p>
    
    <p>This recipe doesn't require pre-soaking the potato wedges before air frying. However, if you have time to <br>
        soak the potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes before seasoning and "frying," the recipe might yield <br>
        even crispier results. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes
            </li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons olive oil
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground paprika
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon parsley flakes
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chili powder
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sea salt
            </li>
            <li>1-8th teaspoon ground black pepper
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong> 

                <p>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                <p>Cut each potato in half lengthwise. Cut each half in half lengthwise, and then cut each quarter in half lengthwise. You will have 16 wedges.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                <p>Place potato wedges in a large bowl. Add olive oil, paprika, parsley, chili, salt, and pepper; mix until well combined.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
                <p>Place 1/2 of the potato wedges in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
                <p>Flip wedges with tongs and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Remove to a plate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
                <p>Repeat to cook the remaining wedges.
                </p>
            </li>
