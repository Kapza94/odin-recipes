        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
            </li>
            <li>Â½ (21 ounce) can blueberry pie filling
            </li>
            <li>butter-flavored cooking spray
            </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse sugar for sprinkling
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong> 

                <p>Roll out each circle of pie dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut<br> 
                    circles into the dough using a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to make 16 circles (8<br>
                    from each dough round). If you don't have a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter, you can use the<br>
                    mouth of a large cup or wide-mouth jar.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                <p>Moisten the edge of a circle with water, then add 2 tablespoons blueberry pie filling in<br>
                    the center (or however much can fit while still leaving the edges bare).<br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                <p>Place another dough circle on top of the filling and pinch the edges of the two dough<br>
                    rounds together to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges to secure them further. Add a<br>
                    slit in the top of the crust with a sharp knife. Repeat with the remaining dough circles<br>
                    until you have 8 round pies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
                <p>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and spray the air fryer basket<br>
                    with cooking spray. Place pies in the basket in a single layer (you may need to work in<br>
                    batches). Spray the tops of the pies with more cooking spray, and sprinkle the tops <br>
                    with coarse sugar.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
                <p>Cook in the air fryer until golden brown, about 9 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
